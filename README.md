# MedicalAssist

MedicalAssist is a web app designed to assist students and doctors in diagnosing medical issues.
The idea behind the web app was to design a system that could take in a description of a patient's
symptoms and output a list of the top most likely diagnoses. This system could ideally help
doctors see some diagnoses they may not have considered, or it could help students or individuals
learn about some possible diagnoses given their situation.
